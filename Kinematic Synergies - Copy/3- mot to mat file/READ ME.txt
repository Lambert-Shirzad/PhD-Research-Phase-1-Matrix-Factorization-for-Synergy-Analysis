Run IK in OpenSim and save the .mot files.
open .mot files in excel and save as .xlsx.
then run the Xlsx2Mat.m file to reduce the data from ~170 columns to the 17 columns (i.e. the joint motions that are important).
Then run CreatKFolds.m to combine the .mat files into k folds. The new files will be used for training and the files from the Xlsx2Mat.m 
will be used for evaluation. Each fold will be a continuous 40s time period which is not a good way of defining folds (so don't use it!)
Use CreateFullSet.m to combine all the time periods for one subject into one big data set (Full data set for that subject).
