# PhD-Research-Phase-1-Matrix-Factorization-for-Synergy-Analysis

- This is the analysis code I wrote for the first major study of my PhD.
- This work investigates what matrix factorization method is better suited for kinematic and muscle synergies analysis. 
The considered matrix factorization methods are: Principal Component Analysis, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Independent Component Analysis.
- The pdf file is the journal paper I published based on this work. The data that was used for this analysis is not included here.
